# Homework assigment 1
* Read the first two lessons of this tutorial: https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/
  * [Lesson 1: Building Your First Web Page](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/)
  * [Lesson 2: Getting to Know HTML](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/)
* Add 2 extensions to this page:
  * Add 1 more pet with your own image, description, etc.
  * Add one more feature of your choice. Maybe a list of local animal shelters, a new page with a complete bio for one of the pets (immunizations, favorite toys, evil nemesis), whatever you want!
* When you're done making changes, commit them using `git` and push your changes to github:
  * Open a terminal and `cd` until you're inside the project directory. e.g. Run something like `cd ~/projects/adopt-a-pet`
  * Commit your changes. Run `git status` to see what you changed. If it looks good, run `git add .` which means "add all the changes in the current directory to my new commit". Then run `git commit -m "Homework assignment 1"` to commit the changes.
  * Push your updates to github: `git push` should do it.
  * Treat yoself! You've earned a pat on the back.
